Significant Achievements

Since joining Nomura in June 2025, I have delivered multiple high-impact automation initiatives for SAP BusinessObjects in close collaboration with the Operations and Application Administration teams. My primary contribution has been converting operational requirements into reliable, scalable, and future-ready automation while ensuring alignment with SAP standards and Nomura governance.

The most significant achievement was the SAP BusinessObjects User Access Provisioning & Revoke Automation, where I replaced a partially implemented, deprecated Java SDK–based solution with a RESTful Web Services–based implementation aligned with SAP’s future roadmap. During this work, I addressed critical gaps where neither the legacy SDK nor REST APIs supported required functionality (such as on-demand LDAP sync). To mitigate this, I designed and implemented a fallback UI automation framework, ensuring workflow stability and eliminating manual intervention. This solution has been successfully handed over to the integration team for end-to-end workflow adoption.

I also delivered the Scheduled Instances On-Demand Export Automation, addressing a long-standing operational challenge where SAP BO did not provide native export capabilities for scheduled instances. Using the fallback UI automation framework and Ansible surveys, I enabled parameter-driven exports across environments and regions, automatically delivering spreadsheet outputs to users. This solution significantly reduced manual effort and improved operational efficiency and auditability.

In addition, I developed Promotion Management Automation for non-production environments using Ansible, Python, and SAP’s LCM CLI. This automation streamlined complex migration workflows, reduced execution errors, and standardized content promotion across environments. The solution is ready for QA and designed for future integration with self-service portals.

Beyond individual projects, I built a reusable UI automation framework and a SAP BO Object Picker UI POC, laying the foundation for centralized, user-friendly execution of automation workflows beyond the limitations of Ansible surveys. Across all initiatives, I maintained strong ownership from design through handover, invested significant effort in studying SAP documentation, and ensured solutions were robust, maintainable, and extensible.

Areas of Improvement 

Leadership & Influence

During this review period, my contributions were primarily execution-focused, with a strong emphasis on technical delivery and implementation. I worked closely with Ops and Application Administration stakeholders who provided domain expertise and guided automation priorities. This collaborative approach enabled effective and timely delivery of high-quality automation solutions.

However, I recognize an opportunity to further strengthen my leadership impact beyond execution. As the automation solutions mature and move toward wider adoption, I aim to increase my involvement in early-stage solution discussions, prioritization, and design conversations, rather than focusing predominantly on implementation.

Key development areas include:
	•	Increasing visibility and influence through structured knowledge-sharing sessions, walkthroughs, and demos.
	•	Contributing more actively to solution shaping and automation standards as adoption scales.
	•	Gradually taking on opportunities to mentor or guide peers, particularly around automation patterns, tooling, and best practices.

Action Plan:
	•	Proactively participate in design and requirement discussions with Ops and stakeholders.
	•	Conduct regular walkthroughs for delivered automation to support adoption and shared understanding.
	•	Build confidence in guiding best practices while maintaining strong delivery ownership.

This development focus will help me evolve from a strong individual contributor into a broader technical leader, while continuing to deliver high-impact automation aligned with Nomura’s goals.
